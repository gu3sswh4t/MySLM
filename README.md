# MySLM: Accessing Self-Learning Modules

MySLM provides easy access to self-learning modules (SLMs) for students, primarily designed for Cogon National High School but adaptable for other schools within the Schools Division of the Island Garden City of Samal.  This project leverages learning materials from the LRMDS Division of Island Garden City of Samal and DepEd Central Office.

**Disclaimer:** The app creator does not own any of the learning materials. All rights and credits belong to their respective owners at LRMD Division of Island Garden City of Samal and DepEd Central Office.  This project focuses solely on providing a convenient platform for accessing these materials.

## Accessing MySLM

MySLM can be accessed in two ways:

1.  **Web Browser:** Open your web browser and navigate to https://tinyurl.com/App-ModuleX.

    *   **Install (Windows/macOS Chrome):** If you are using Google Chrome on Windows or macOS, you can install the app directly from your browser.  When you visit the MySLM website, look for an "Install" button or icon (often a plus sign) near the address bar. Clicking this will install the app, providing a more integrated experience.

    *   **Continue in Browser:** If you choose not to install, or if you are using a different browser, you can still access and browse the content directly through your browser.

2.  **iOS Devices:** For iOS users, access the website at https://tinyurl.com/App-ModuleX and then add the website to your home screen. This will create an app-like shortcut for convenient access.

## Finding Learning Materials

To easily locate your desired modules, use the **search field** provided within the app.  Simply type in keywords related to the module you're looking for.

## Downloading Learning Materials

To conserve device storage, MySLM does *not* automatically download all learning materials.  Users must selectively download the modules they need.

1.  **Download:** Click the download button or the name of the module to save it locally to your device.

2.  **Offline Access:** Once a module is downloaded, it can be accessed offline.

**Important:** Do *not* clear the cache and cookies of the app or browser, as this will delete the downloaded assets from your device.  Ensure you have sufficient storage space for the modules you choose to download.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with MySLM, please try the following steps:

1.  **Reload:** First, try reloading the page. This often resolves minor glitches.

2.  **Clear Cache and Cookies (Last Resort):** If reloading doesn't work, and the problem persists, you may need to clear the cache and cookies of your app and/or browser.  **This should be your last resort**, as it will remove all downloaded assets, and you will have to download them again for offline access.  Only do this if absolutely necessary.

## Clearing Cache and Cookies

Here's how to clear the cache and cookies on common mobile platforms, including clearing from device settings:

**Android (Chrome):**

    5.  Check the boxes for "Cookies and site data" and "Cached images and files."
    6.  Tap "Clear data."
*   **From Settings (May vary by device):**
    1.  Open the Settings app.
    2.  Go to "Apps" or "Applications."
    3.  Find and select "Chrome."
    4.  Tap "Storage" or "Storage & cache."
    5.  Tap "Clear cache" and "Clear data" or "Clear storage." (Clearing data will also clear cache and cookies)

**iOS (Safari):**

*   **From Safari (Clears history, cookies, and data):**
    1.  Open the Settings app.
    2.  Tap "Safari."
    3.  Tap "Clear History and Website Data."

    2.  Tap "Safari."
    3.  Tap "Advanced."
